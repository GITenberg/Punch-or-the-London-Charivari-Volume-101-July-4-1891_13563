    <h3>URBI ET ORBI.</h3>

    <p>Mr. PUNCH returns thanks for the anticipatory
    congratulations on the occasion of his Jubilee, and takes this
    opportunity of informing his friends&mdash;which means
    Everybody Everywhere&mdash;that the 50th anniversary of his
    natal day is July 18 <i>prox.</i>, which day Mr. PUNCH hereby
    gives full and entire permission to the aforesaid Everyone
    Everywhere to keep as a whole Holiday, and do in a general way,
    and to the utmost of their ability, just exactly what best
    pleases them.</p>

        did not meet with their approval."&mdash;<i>Daily

    </blockquote>

    <p class="scene">SCENE&mdash;<i>A Studio in the Royal Academy.
    The</i> President <i>and several</i> Members of the Council
    <i>waiting arrival of Government to inspect their most recent
    purchase.</i></p>

    <p><i>President</i> (<i>with assumed joviality</i>). Well, my
    dear Colleagues, I do not think exception <i>can</i> be taken
    to this composition. Simple and effective, is it not?</p>

    <p><i>First Member of Council</i> (<i>gloomily</i>). Oh, you
    never know! I think we ought to have opposed the admission of
    the Cabinet&mdash;what should <i>they</i> know about Art?</p>

    <p><i>Second Mem</i>. (<i>drily</i>). Enough to make speeches
    at the annual dinner&mdash;to which they wouldn't come if we
    snubbed them.</p>

    <p><i>First Mem</i>. What of that? I am sure the President is
    quite eloquent enough to stand alone.</p>

    <p><i>Pres</i>. (<i>with a graceful bow</i>). You are most
    kind. But, hush! here comes Lord SALISBURY!</p>

    <p class="center"><i>Enter the</i> PRIME MINISTER. <i>Cordial
    greetings.</i></p>

    <p><i>Premier</i> (<i>briskly</i>). I am sure you will forgive
    me if I get through this quickly. (<i>Looking at picture.</i>)
    Hm! Yes, very nice; but <i>did</i> EDWARD the Black Prince wear
    his Garter ribbon in battle? I am sure I refrain from appearing
    in mine under similar circumstances. (<i>To</i> Pres.) Do you
    think the Artist could paint it out?</p>

    <p><i>Pres</i>. I feel sure he will do everything in his power
    to satisfy your Lordship's artistic instincts.</p>

    <p><i>Premier</i>. Just so.</p>

    <p class="bracket">[<i>Exit</i> R. <i>when enter</i> FIRST LORD
    of the TREASURY, L.</p>

    <p><i>Pres</i>. (<i>greeting new-comer cordially</i>). Most
    glad to see you, my dear Right Hon. Sir!</p>

    <p><i>First Lord</i>. Very good indeed of you to say so, but am
    always anxious to do my duty to my Queen and Country.
    (<i>Gazing at picture.</i>) Hm! Not bad! But, I say, I do know
    something of yachting, and that isn't the way to brace up the
    marling-spike to the fokesell yard with the main jibboom three
    points in a wind with some East in it! If I may venture a
    suggestion&mdash;hope Artist will paint out the gondola. Ta-ta!
    A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    [<i>Exit.</i></p>

    <p><i>Pres</i>. Well, well, I do not know what our friend will
    think of the matter, but perhaps the Hansom of Venice <i>is</i>
    a little superfluous. Why here is the HOME SECRETARY.</p>

    <p class="bracket">[<i>Enter that august personage&mdash;mutual
    greeting.</i></p>

    <p><i>Home Sec</i>. (<i>examining picture</i>). Yes, very nice.
    Just my idea of what a historical picture <i>should</i> be!
    Sea-view very fair indeed, and I think that the suggestion of
    the presentation at Court is also extremely neat. The Black
    Prince, perhaps, a little near OLIVER CROMWELL, but then that
    is a detail that will not challenge particular attention. I
    like too the view of Vauxhall Gardens&mdash;very good, indeed!
    But why should a scene of this great historical importance be
    laid in Charing Cross during a labour demonstration?</p>

    <p><i>Pres</i>. (<i>frankly</i>). I cannot say that I have
    looked up all my authorities, but I do not think our friend
    would allow himself to be wrong on so important a point.</p>

    <p><i>Home Sec</i>. Well, I think it would be in better taste
    if the Artist cut out that stampede of police&mdash;it is not
    true to nature!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Exit.</i></p>

    <p><i>Pres</i>. There <i>may</i> be something in what he says,
    but I do wish these amateurs would keep their suggestions to
    themselves.</p>

    <p class="bracket"><i>Enter</i> FIRST LORD of the
    ADMIRALTY.</p>

    <p><i>Pres</i>. (<i>cordially</i>). My dear Lord, delighted to
    see you&mdash;what do you think of it?</p>

    <p><i>First Lord</i>. Hm! Yes! Perhaps! But, I say, what right
    has the Artist to put the white ensign on the top of that
    light-house? It's against the regulations&mdash;they should be
    flying the Trinity House flag&mdash;if anything. That
    <i>must</i> come out, you know&mdash;it really must!
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Exit.</i></p>

    <p><i>Pres</i>. Silly blunder, but it can be easily remedied.
    Ah! the Secretary of State for War! (<i>Enter that
    official</i>) Well, Mr. STANHOPE, and how do <i>you</i> like
    the new purchase?</p>

    <p><i>War Minister</i> (<i>after, a glance at the canvas</i>).
    Tol lol. But come, I say, come; the Iron Duke never wore a hat
    like <i>that</i>! And, I say, as it isn't raining, why has he
    put up his umbrella? In the cause of historical accuracy that
    should not be allowed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [<i>Exit.</i></p>

    <p><i>Pres</i>. (<i>drily</i>). I am afraid our friend will
    have enough to do. (<i>Enter the remainder of the Cabinet
    together</i>). Well, Gentlemen&mdash;hope you approve of our
    purchase?</p>

    <p><i>Remainder</i> (<i>together</i>). Not at all. You should
    have only bought the frame! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Scene closes
    in on the consideration of this new point.</i></p>

    <p>Colonel NORTH is popularly supposed to have been the
    architect of his own fortune, but he doesn't seem to have
    profited much by his architectural knowledge when applied to
    house-building. The burly Colonel&mdash;we forget at this
    moment what regiment is under his distinguished
    command&mdash;has met many a great personage in his time, but,
    like the eminent barbarian who encountered a Christian
    Archbishop for the first time&mdash;St. Ambrose, we rather
    think it was, but no matter&mdash;our bold Colonel had to climb
    down a bit on coming face to face with the Lord Chief Justice
    of England. What a cast for a scene out of <i>Henry the Fourth!
    Falstaff</i>, Colonel NORTH, and My Lord COLERIDGE for the
    <i>Lord Chief Justice</i>. The scene might be Part II., Act
    ii., Scene 1, when the Lord Chief says to <i>Sir John</i>, "You
    speak as having power to do wrong; but answer, in the effect of
    your reputation, and satisfy the poor woman,"&mdash;only for
    "woman," read "architect." Curious that the name of GAMBLE
    should be the pre-surname of Mister Colonel NORTH'S brother.
    What's in a name? Yet there's a good deal in the sound and look
    of GAMBLE NORTH, especially when up before the Lord Chief, who
    must quite recently have got hold of quite a little library of
    useful knowledge. Also odd that most of Mr. NORTH'S money seems
    to have been made in the South. But "A 1," that is, the
    architect, won, and the gallant Mister Colonel, or Colonel
    Mister, left the Court, feeling comparatively A-Norther man.
    Never mind, even the Millionairey Colonel can't always be
    lucky.</p>

    to date by performing the Musical Prodigy Son's, I mean
    MENDELSSOHN'S "Songs without Words;" and this so effectively,
    that the last wordless song he was obliged to repeat, and much
    obliged the audience by repeating. Then the good fellar played

    <h4>THE COMPOSITION OF THE PARTY.</h4>

    <p>Well, you know what it was once upon a time. There was A
    BALFOUR&mdash;beg pardon, should say, THE BALFOUR&mdash;and
    DRUMMY WOLFFY, and <i>De</i> GORSTIBUS <i>non disputandum</i>
    ("no arguing with GORST"), and self. As good a quartette,
    though I say it who shouldn't, as ever sat down to a concerted
    piece, with myself as First Fiddle. But now&mdash;"Where am dat
    barty now?"&mdash;I don't know if I quote correctly; quoting
    correctly is not my <i>forte</i>. "Dat barty," suggests WOLFF;
    he was the "barty" of our party, in the merry days of old.
    Now&mdash;none of 'em here, and I with my ink-stand before me,
    a pencil, a pen, note-books galore, and any amount of foolscap,

    <p>Before I know where we are, so to speak, we have left
    London, and are at Lisbon. On the voyage Captain G. WILLIAMS
    suggests these lines, to which I append my own translation.
    BALFOUR rather behind me in Latin at Eton (I hear by private
    wire that he admitted as much in his recent speech at the
    fourth centenary celebration), and so, perhaps, couldn't give
    the translation as easily as I do. Here is the Captain's
    reminiscence, and my translation when he isn't
    looking:&mdash;</p><br clear="all" />

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Ille terrarum mihi pr&aelig;ter omnes</p>

    <p>He, the Englishman (<i>Angulus</i>), beside me (that is,
    "sitting on deck by my side") laughs at all people on shore
    when he is quite certain (<i>certat</i>) that he can't get good
    tobacco from VENAFER'S (a local tobacconist). (This) man
    prefers the long clay pipe, which gets so soon hot, for, by
    Jove, you'll burn yourself (<i>brumas</i>), and being a friend
    of AULON'S ("all on," local joke), he envies those who can
    smoke the green tobacco, and doesn't wonder that they go in for
    Falernian (<i>classic metaphor for Cape wine</i>).</p>

    <p>I think that's pretty good for an old Etonian who could give
    BALFOUR (the "Four" of the Fourth Party, a four-oar without a
    steerer) a mile over any course of VIRGIL or OVID, and beat him
    easily.</p>

    <h4>CAPERING.</h4>

    <p>There are 50,000 souls and as many bodies in Cape Town. Give
    you my word, it's a fact. I may have omitted one or two, but
    saw most of 'em through telescope before landing. There's an
    old Town House and a Castle, and an Excellency for Governor;
    Museum, Library, with Manuscripts badly illuminated before the
    discovery of gas; and as good a glass of Port (called here
    "Port Elizabeth," after Miss ELIZABETH MARTIN, who first took
    to it, but didn't finish it, thank goodness!) as you'd wish to
    get away from the Turf Club. The little boys toss for halfpence
    in the street, which impressed me with the wonderful mineral
    wealth of South Africa. Having nothing better to do, I joined
    them, and won. I lectured them on incautious play, and they
    said something in South-African, which the street Arabs here
    speak to perfection, and which, I fancy, was both flattering
    and apologetic. Called on CECIL, the Colossus of Rhodes, but he
    was absent at the time. Fine place, the Cape. "Why," I asked
    myself, "do our people go to Ramsgate, Southend, Herne Bay, and
    even Scarborough, when there is such a splendid seaside place
    as this to come to?" But no; because their people have done it
    before them, so they'll go on doing; and, unlike yours, truly,
    they <i>won't strike out a line of their own</i>. [N.B.&mdash;I
    must beg the Editor, when he gets this, not to strike out any

    <p>Had a game of single-handed poker with one of the Trekkers,
    and beat him hollow. Not at first, of course, out of
    politeness; but at game No. 3 he was nowhere. Bless him, I knew
    a "trek" worth any three of his. He wanted to go about with me
    after this, but he became such a Boer (that's the origin of our
    word at home signifying "nuisance") that I cut him, and his
    pack of cards too. Just off to see the Dutch races. Shall pick
    up a little coin over this. You'll excuse my not writing any
    more this week, as I have to send a lot of stun to the <i>Daily
    Graphic</i>, besides cramming and reading up for it far more
    than ever I did at Oxford. However, the <i>jeu d'esprit</i> is
    well worth the <i>chandelle</i>. You don't want much about
    local politics&mdash;do you? If so, wire's the word, and I'm
    there. Looking forward to see
    <i>What-can-the-Matter-be-Land</i>, also SAM BEST, and other
    old friends, with whose names, at least, the papers have
    already made you familiar. Must be off now, as I've an
    interview with the High Commissioner, who does all my business
    for me at the native races. Obliged to give him twenty per
    cent. on commission, and that, of course, is the reason why he
    has earned the proud title of "High," which he now deservedly
    enjoys. "How's that for High?" And the answer is, "Fifteen per
    cent. on ordinary business, and twenty per cent. for a win."
    Newmarket not in it with this place. So for the present, "Adoo,
    adoo!" Mind you, I've got my eyes open, and this is my tip for
    all the country out here, "White to win in a few moves," [to
    which I shall soon be able to put you up], and "Black not to
    win anyhow." Very hot out here; dry work, scribbling; but
    luckily in the Orange Free State that delicious fruit can be
    had for the asking. Tell GORSTY that, and WOLFFY can use the
    information, if he likes, till I return. <i>Au revoir!</i>

    <h2>LEAVES FROM A CANDIDATE'S DIARY.</h2>

    <p><i>Billsbury, Tuesday, 3rd June.</i>&mdash;We had an immense
    meeting here last night, just to keep the enthusiasm going. We
    had done our best to got a Cabinet Minister to come down, but
    they all had some excuse or other, and we had to content
    ourselves with CARDEW, who, being an Undersecretary, is the
    next best thing to the genuine Cabinet rose. VULLIAMY came too.
    A most extraordinary chap that. Instead of being offended at
    what I did with reference to his proposals for wholesale
    illegality, he merely delivered his soul of what he called "a
    gentle protest," and declared himself ready to do all he could
    to help me to counteract the effects of my own obstinacy. There
    was considerable difficulty, as there always is, in
    apportioning the various speeches, so as not to leave any of
    the important local chiefs out of the proceedings. First of all
    TOLLAND, as Chairman, opened the proceedings. Then came a vote
    of confidence in Her Majesty's Government, proposed by Colonel
    CHORKLE, and seconded by VULLIAMY. To this CARDEW
    responded.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:20%;">
        <a href="images/004-3.png"><img width="100%"

             alt="Free and Independent Elector." /></a>Free and
             Independent Elector.
    </div>

    <p>Then MOFFAT proposed, and JERRAM seconded, a vote of
    confidence in me, to which, of course, I responded. Old DICKY
    DIKES proposed a vote of thanks to the Chairman. This was
    seconded by BLISSOP, and after a few cordial words from
    TOLLAND, the gathering broke up. On the whole, everything went
    off extremely well. VULLIAMY'S speech was a masterpiece. He
    said:&mdash;</p>

    <p>"I turn from the larger questions of public policy to the
    private concerns of the borough of Billsbury. On previous
    occasions I have had an opportunity of saying what I think of
    your Candidate, Mr. PATTLE. I have known him for years. Ever
    since I first met him, I have been more and more struck by the
    extraordinary intelligent interest he takes in political
    matters. His views are enlightened, his judgment is sound, and
    his eloquence is of so high an order as to ensure to him a
    brilliant success in the House he is destined to adorn. But
    what chiefly commends him to my regard and to yours, is the
    honourable uprightness of his character. The contest here will
    be a fierce and determined one; but, thank heaven, with such a
    Candidate as yours, it will be kept free from all personal
    bitterness, and will be conducted in such a way that no breath
    of suspicion will rest on the absolute and scrupulous legality
    of everything that may be done. The conscience of the people
    demands this of the candidates who may appeal to its suffrages,
    and, speaking as an old man, I can only say that I rejoice to
    see those who are yet young bearing themselves so honourably,
    and maintaining the great traditions which have made of England
    the greatest and proudest nation in the world, and have
    advanced Billsbury to a position of glorious prosperity which
    other towns strive in vain to approach."</p>

    <p>This from VULLIAMY was splendid, considering that if I had
    followed his advice, I should have steeped myself in
    illegality. But the cheers that greeted the speech were
    deafening, the most enthusiastic coming from MOFFAT, BLISSOP,
    and JERRAM, who had urged my compliance with VULLIAMY'S
    suggestions.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday, June 4th.</i>&mdash;The <i>Meteor</i> is
    furious about our meeting yesterday. It says, in a
    leader:&mdash;"Do these gentlemen suppose that the froth blown
    by them over the addle-pates who cheered their speeches is
    likely to shake sir THOMAS CHUBSON from the secure position in
    which the affection of the Billsbury public has enthroned him?
    We have nothing to say against Mr. PATTLE except this, that his
    youth, combined with the ridiculous immaturity of his views,
    absolutely disqualifies him for the responsible post to which
    his foolish ambition aspires. Let him go back to the briefs,
    which the vivid imagination of his supporters pictures as
    crowding his table in the Temple. Let him join debating
    societies, and learn how to speak in public; let him eat,
    drink, and be merry in London; let him, in fact, do anything
    except run the head which flattery has turned against the
    sturdy stone of Billsbury Liberalism. We give him this advice
    in no unfriendly spirit. Let him be wise in time, and take
    it."</p>

    <p>The <i>Guardian</i> is of course jubilant. "Never," it says,
    "has it been our lot to hear the magnificent principles of our
    cause expounded with an eloquence so convincing. Mr. CARDEW
    spoke, as he always does, with that sturdy good sense which has
    not only made him a redoubtable foe in the House of Commons,
    but has endeared his name to the masses of the English people.
    Mr. VULLIAMY again showed himself a master of the great
    questions of finance, and held his audience enthralled while he
    contrasted the futile extravagance of Liberal Governments with
    the wise, but generous economies, established by those who now
    hold the reins of Government. Our popular and eloquent young
    Candidate, Mr. PATTLE, showed himself not unworthy to take his
    place side by side with the two great men we have mentioned
    upon the Government benches. Rarely has any
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page5"
       id="page5"></a>[pg 5]</span> meeting displayed greater
       enthusiasm and unanimity. Our wretched opponents may well
       hide their diminished heads. Another nail has been struck
       into the coffin of the CHUBSONS, and the rest of the gang
       whom the unfortunate apathy of the Conservatives, at the
       last election, permitted to rise to high places in Billsbury
       politics. They have earned their doom. <i>Sic semper
       tyrannis!</i>"</p>

    <p>There's a curious paragraph in a little weekly sort of
    Society rag published in Billsbury. It says:&mdash;"Mr. PATTLE
    has prolonged his stay in Billsbury for some time. Can it
    <i>all</i> be politics? I say nothing. But others have been
    heard to whisper nothings which are sweet. What price bonnets?"
    I suppose the idiot means to hint that there's something
    between me and Miss PENFOLD? Hope MARY won't hear of this
    rubbish.</p>

    <h2>MODERN TYPES.</h2>

    <p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Own Type Writer.</i>)</p>

    <h4>No. XXVI.&mdash;THE LADY SHOPKEEPER.</h4>

    <p>Ladies who, in order to correct the inequalities of fortune,
    or to counteract a spendthrift husband, have betaken themselves
    to the keeping of shops, form a large and rapidly-increasing
    body. In times so ancient as to be scarcely within the memory
    of a juvenile dowager, it was held by the high dry exponents of
    aristocratic privilege that to touch trade, even when it
    proffered a bag of money in a well-gloved hand, was to be
    defiled beyond the restoring power of a Belgravian Duchess. To
    be sure, even the highest and the driest of these censors
    contrived to close an indulgent eye when a moneyless scion of
    nobility sought to prop his tottering house by rebuilding it
    upon a commercial foundation, and cementing it with the dower
    of a "tradesman's" daughter. But if these blameless ones, whose
    exclusive dust has long since been consigned to family vaults
    with appropriate inscriptions, could have foreseen the dreadful
    inroads of the trading spirit, if in a moment of prophetic
    rapture they could have watched the painful decay of caste
    which permits a lady to dabble in bonnets, to toy with the
    making of fancy frames, to cut dresses almost like a
    dressmaker, and, horror of horrors, to send in bills to her
    customers, surely they would have refrained from the tomb in
    order to stem the tide of advancing demoralisation. But they
    are dead, and we who remain are left to deal as best we may
    with the uncompromising spirit of the age.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:30%;">
        <a href="images/005-1.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/005-1.png"
             alt="Woman in profile" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>It is absolutely essential to the proper production of a
    Lady Shopkeeper that she should have been at one time both
    affluent and socially distinguished. If to these qualities she
    can add the supreme advantage of good looks and a modest
    demeanour, her career is certain to be a prosperous and a rapid
    one. If, finally, she has been mated to a husband who, having
    long ago spent his own cash, contrives in a short time to run a
    best on record through hers, if he is a good fellow of a sort,
    with a capacity for making friends which is as large as his
    generosity in staking money, she may be sure that no element
    will be wanting to her success. It is of course unnecessary
    that she should have served any apprenticeship to the trade
    that she ultimately adopts. When, after some glittering seasons
    of horses and footmen and brilliant parties, the crash comes
    upon the little household, her friends will be called into
    council. Some will recommend a retired life in a distant
    suburb, where it is currently reported that &pound;250 a year
    may be made to play the part of &pound;2,000 in the heart of
    May Fair. Others will hint that governesses have been known,
    after years of painful labour, to lay by a sufficiency for a
    short old age; others, again, will dive into the storehouse of
    their reminiscences, in order to produce for inspection the
    well-known example of a colonel and his wife, who defied both
    the fates and the rheumatism in the modest <i>pension</i> of a
    Continental watering-place. All these suggestions, however, are
    eventually put aside in favour of the advice that a shop should
    be started, a <i>nom de commerce</i> adopted, and a circle of
    friendly customers be acquired by discreet advertisement. After
    these matters have been decided, but not till then, it becomes
    necessary to determine to what special branch the talents of
    the prospective Shopkeeper are to be devoted. At last even this
    is accomplished, and in a few months more the world of fashion
    may learn by private circular or public paragraph, that a new
    competitor for its favours has been launched into commercial
    activity under a sweetly symbolical name.</p>

    <p>After this everything depends upon the Lady herself. At
    first everything will go swimmingly. Friends will rally round
    her, and she may perhaps discover with a touching surprise that
    the staunchest and truest are those of whom, in her days of
    brilliant prosperity, she thought the least. But a
    <i>succ&egrave;s d'estime</i> is soon exhausted. Unless she
    conducts her business on purely business lines, delivers her
    goods when they are wanted, and, for her own protection, sends
    in her accounts as they fall due, and looks carefully after
    their payment, her customers and her profits will fall away.
    But if she attends strictly to business herself, or engages a
    good business woman to assist her, and orders her affairs in
    accordance with the dictates of a proper self-interest, she is
    almost certain to do well, and to reap the reward of those who
    face the world without flinching, and fight the battle of life
    sturdily and with an honest purpose. Some painful moments may
    fall to her lot. It may be that in a crowded assemblage of
    wealth and fashion she may see one of her masterpieces in the
    dress-making art, torn into shreds under the clumsy heel of a
    Cabinet Minister, or a Duchess may speak unkindly in her
    hearing of her latest devices in floral decoration. Or, some
    brainless nincompoop may, in his ignorance of her profession,
    cast aspersions on the general character and behaviour of all
    who keep shops. And it may be that friends, after a prolonged
    period of non-payment, will desert her, and speak ill of her
    business. But she will be able to console herself for those and
    similar bitternesses by the knowledge that on the whole the
    world honours those who battle against ill-fortune without
    complaint far above the needy crowd of spongers who strive to
    batten without effort on the crumbs that fall from the tables
    of the rich.</p>

    <p>Well, we are jest a going for to have a fine time of it in
    the old Citty, we are! On the werry tenth of next month, which
    this year happens for to be Jewly, we are a going for to
    receive to Lunshon, quite in a frendly way, the Hemperer and
    the Hempress of all GERMANY, not forgitting Hellygoland which
    we so kindly guv 'em larst year, and, in addishun, about twenty
    other princes and princesses from differing forren parts, as
    has all agreed for to cum at the same time to do 'em honour,
    and as if that wasn't quite enuff for one day, the noble Prince
    of WHALES, and the butiful Princess of WHALES, and all the
    Royal Family, will be werry much "hall there" for to receeve
    'em and shew 'em praps the luvlyest site in Urope, wiz., the
    butiful Gildhall made into a bower of roses, and covered with
    reel dammarsk tablecloths from top to bottom, and them all
    covered with such a fairy-like Lunshon as makes my pore old
    mouth water ony jest to think upon! There's one thing as I'm
    afraid as His Himperial Madjesty will be werry angry at, and
    that is, as they ain't a going for to make him free of the
    Citty, which is one of them grate honners as all the
    celibryties of the World pines for. BROWN says it ain't
    <i>commy fo</i>, as the French says, but BROWN don't know
    everythink, tho' he is a trying his werry best to learn a few
    German words in case the Hemperer asks him for sumthink to eat,
    such as a little sour krowt. The best of the fun is that he
    acshally spells sour, <i>sauer!</i> I ain't not a pertickler
    good speller myself, but I reely shoud be artily ashamed of
    sich a blunder as that.</p>

    <p>The pore Committee, as has to see to hewerythink, begins for
    to look jest a little pail and worryed&mdash;and who can wunder
    at it, for I'm told as they is amost torn to peaces with
    applications for Tickets, tho they ony has two a-peace for
    their friends, and won't have one for theirselves, but will
    have to walk about all the time of the Lunch, with their long
    sticks of office, to see as ewerybody xcept theirselves is nice
    and cumferal, and got plenty to eat and drink. And, torking of
    drink, jest reminds me of the tasting Committee, pore fellers!
    who has got for to go to all the werry best Wine sellers in the
    Citty, to taste all their werry best wines, and decide which,
    of every kind and description, they shall select for their
    himperial royal gests. Why it's amost enuff to give 'em all
    hedakes for the rest of their nateral lives.</p>

    <p>I don't know of any further arrangements as is quite finally
    settled, so praps I may have jest a few lines to add nex
    week.</p>

    person kindly inform me of a good Recitation for a Smoking
    Concert? I have been asked to recite "something telling" after
    the annual banquet of a Club of local Licensed Victuallers. I
    am thinking of the First Book of <i>Paradise Lost</i>. Or would
    parts of <i>The Excursion</i> be more likely to create a
    <i>furore</i>? I have never recited in public before, and feel

    Exhibition. On this particular evening, there has been a slight
    hitch in the culinary arrangements, and the relations between
    the Chef and the Waiters are apparently strained. Enter an
    Egotistic Amphitryon, followed by a meek and youthful
    Guest.</i></p>

    <p><i>The Egotistic Amphitryon</i> (<i>concluding an
    harangue</i>). Well, all <i>I</i>'ve got to say is I've been
    here half-an-hour&mdash;(<i>with a bitter sense of the anomaly
    of the situation</i>)&mdash;waiting about for <i>You!!</i>
    (<i>They seat themselves at one of the little tables under the
    verandah.</i>) Oh, you're going to sit <i>that</i> side, are
    you? It's all the same to me, except that there's a confounded
    draught here which&mdash;well, you're young, and these things
    don't affect you&mdash;or oughtn't to. (<i>They exchange
    sides.</i>) We shall have to hurry our dinner now, if we mean
    to hear anything of the music. That was the reason I expressly
    told you seven sharp. Here, Waiter! (Waiter <i>presents a
    carte, and stands by with a proud humility.</i>) Now, what are
    you going to have? (<i>To</i> Guest.) You don't mind? I hate to
    hear a man say he doesn't care what he eats&mdash;he
    <i>ought</i> to care, he <i>must</i> care. What do you say to
    this&mdash;"Potage Bisque d'&eacute;crivisses; Saumon Sauce
    Hollandaise; Brimborions de veau farcis &agrave;
    l'impr&eacute;vu; Ducklings and green peas; New Potatoes;
    Salad"? Simple and, ah, satisfying. (<i>To</i> Waiter.) Let us
    have that as sharp as you can; do you hear?</p>

    <p><i>The E.A.</i> Hang the fellow, he's forgotten the wine!
    (<i>To</i> Guest.) What will you drink?</p>

    <p><i>The Guest</i> (<i>thinks it will look greedy if he
    suggests champagne</i>). Oh&mdash;er&mdash;whatever
    <i>you're</i> going to drink.</p>

    <p><i>The E.A.</i> Well, I'm going to have a glass of champagne
    myself. I want it after all this worry. But if you prefer beer
    (<i>considerately</i>), say so. (<i>The</i> Guest, <i>in a
    spirit of propitiation, prefers beer.</i>) Well, we could have
    managed a bottle of Pommery between us, and it's never so good
    to my mind in the pints&mdash;but please yourself, of
    course.</p>

    <p class="bracket">[<i>The</i> Guest <i>feels that his
    moderation has missed fire, but dares not retract; they sit in
    silence for some time, without anything of importance
    happening, except that a strange Waiter swoops down and carries
    away their bread-basket.</i></p>

    <p><i>A Meek Man</i> (<i>at an adjoining table, who, probably
    for family reasons, is entertaining his Sister-in-law, a lady
    with an aquiline nose and remarkably thick eyebrows.</i>) You
    know, HORATIA, I call this sort of thing very jolly, having
    dinner like this in the fresh air, eh? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>He
    rubs his hands under the table.</i></p>

    <p><i>Horatia</i> (<i>acidly</i>). It may be so, AUGUSTUS, when
    we <i>do</i> have it. At present we have been sitting here
    fifteen minutes, and had nothing but fresh air and small flies,
    and, as I don't pretend to be a Chameleon myself, why&mdash;
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>She fans herself vigorously.</i></p>

    <p><i>Augustus</i>. Well, you know, my dear, we were warned
    that the trout <i>en papillotes</i> might take some little
    time. I suppose (<i>with mild Jocularity</i>)&mdash;it's a
    fashionable fish&mdash;wants to come in with a "little head
    sunning over with curls," as the poet says.</p>

    <p><i>Horatia</i>. Please don't make jokes of that
    sort&mdash;unless you wish to destroy the little appetite I
    have left!</p>

    <p><i>Augustus</i> (<i>penitently</i>). Never mind&mdash;I
    won't do it again. Here 's our Waiter at last. <i>Now</i> we're
    all right!</p>

    <p class="bracket">[<i>The</i> Waiter <i>puts a dish down upon

    What the&mdash;</p>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>He goes.</i></p>

    than ever! I suppose you mean to do <i>something</i>,
    AUGUSTUS?</p>

    <p><i>Augustus</i>. Of course&mdash;certainly. I shall speak
    very strongly. (<i>Bleating</i>.) Waiter!</p>

    <p><i>Horatia</i> (<i>with scorn</i>). <i>Do</i> you imagine
    they will pay the least attention to a noise like a sixpenny

    <p><i>A Stern Waiter</i> (<i>appearing suddenly</i>.) You vant

    to express a preference for an Entrec&ocirc;te aux pommes de

    how much longer those rare dainties may take in preparing, and
    in the meantime enable me to support the pangs of starvation by
    procuring me the favour of a penny roll, if I am not
    trespassing too much upon your good-nature?</p>

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <h4>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h4>

    <p><i>House of Commons, Tuesday, June 23</i>, 12'15
    A.M.&mdash;House just adjourned; a little dazed by shock of
    narrow escape from grievous danger. Been at it through greater
    part of night debating Second Reading of Education Bill. JULIUS
    'ANNIBAL PICTON led off with speech of fiery eloquence. The
    SQUIRE of MALWOOD declares he never listens to J.A.P. without
    an odd feeling that there have been misfits. Both his voice and
    his gestures are, he says, too large for him. But that, as
    ALGERNON BORTHWICK shrewdly points out, is professional
    jealousy supervening on the arrogance of excessive stature. The
    SQUIRE, though not lacking in moods of generosity, cannot abear
    a rival in the oratorical field. Had things turned out
    differently to-night, he might have enjoyed the advantage of
    addressing House at this favourable hour, whilst its withers
    were yet unwrung.</p>

    <div class="figleft"

        <a href="images/011-2.png"><img width="100%"

             alt="Sir Algernon." /></a>Sir Algernon.
    </div>

    <p>But JULIUS 'ANNIBAL has not studied his great ancestor's
    strategy for nothing. As soon as Second Reading of Education
    Bill appeared on the paper, he romped in, and put down
    Amendment. Needn't move it; didn't mean to move it; doesn't
    move it; but he gets first place in principal Debate of
    Session, and shows himself worthy of it by the luminous
    argument and almost passionate eloquence of his oration.</p>

    <p>It wasn't that the House was disturbed about. The particular
    incident arose a quarter of an hour before midnight, when
    CRANBORNE suddenly got up and moved Adjournment of Debate. J.A.
    had bowled him and others over in the earlier part of the
    Sitting; but there was a second night, and the HOPE of HATFIELD
    determined he would collar that. Had the Motion for Adjournment
    been accepted, he would, in accordance with usage, have opened
    the ball when the House met again once more, fresh, and in the
    mood to listen. But JOKIM objected to losing the quarter of an
    hour.</p>

    <p>"We can," he said, pleasantly, "bear another speech."</p>

    <p>All right; CRANBORNE only a private Member, and modest
    withal; not the person to argue with his pastors and masters.
    So resumed his seat. If they wanted to use up the time, let
    some one else speak through the quarter of an hour. Had things
    been so left, the listening Senate and the waiting world would
    never have heard CRANBORNE in this Debate. As the SPEAKER
    gently pointed out to him, having moved the Amendment he had
    exhausted his privilege of speaking. He might sustain his
    thesis at any length, or, being on his legs, might continue the
    Debate without insisting on his Motion for the Adjournment. But
    he must speak now, or for ever hold his tongue as far as the
    Debate was concerned. This was awkward; but no help for it; so
    CRANBORNE plunged in and talked up to midnight, when the Debate
    stood adjourned.</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Second Reading of Education Bill
    moved.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;Another night with Education Bill.
    Position rather peculiar; everyone, or nearly everyone, in
    state of frantic adulation of the measure; and yet everyone
    passing the cradle in which the infant slumbers gives it a sly
    pinch. Here and there a Ministerialist gets up and honestly
    denounces a Bill embodying principle which Conservatives been
    led for generations to denounce. BARTLEY last night made
    capital speech in this sense. To-night LAWRENCE bluntly
    declares his regret that good Tories should be asked to support
    principles which they, under their present Leaders, violently
    opposed at General Election of 1885. ADDISON blandly and
    persuasively attempts to stem this growing torrent of
    discontent. "The change of opinion on this side of the House,"
    he said, hitching on one side an imaginary wig, clutching at an
    imperceptible gown, and turning over the pages of an impalpable
    brief, "is owing to the fact that circumstances and times have
    altered. It is the duty of statesmen,"&mdash;and here ADDISON,
    like another Fat Boy known to history, wisibly
    swelled,&mdash;"to adapt themselves to the necessities of the
    case."</p>

    <p>JENNINGS, speaking from the Bench immediately behind
    ADDISON, had no patience with this kind of argument. "Six years
    I've sat in this House, Mr. SPEAKER," he said, "and during that
    time have seen measures which we Conservatives have been
    encouraged, almost instructed, to denounce, cordially received
    by our Leaders and passed into law. For my part, I cannot
    flourish on this diet of broken pledges. One might eat of it
    now and then, but when continually invited to the same dish, it
    becomes a little
    monotonous."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page12"
       id="page12"></a>[pg 12]</span>

    <p>OLD MORALITY happily out of the way of hearing all this.
    Gone off, and wisely left no address. People walking along
    Downing Street, find written over the door at the Treasury,
    "Back in Ten Minutes." That's all; neither date nor hour
    specified. Ten minutes roll on, and OLD MORALITY comes not. But
    he sometimes communicates with his most intimate friends. Have
    this morning a note from him.</p>

    <p>"I send these few lines," he writes, "hoping they will find
    you well as they leave me at present. Talking about lines, mine
    have fallen in pleasanter places than yours, or JOKIM'S chance
    to be just now. Some people are inclined to deny me the faculty
    of humour. But I think the merry-go-rounder of leaving JOKIM in
    charge of the Free Education Bill is pretty well for a
    beginner. Everything must have a commencement. Now I've started
    I may in time become a regular JOSEPH MILLER. Excuse my not
    mentioning my present address, and be sure that wherever I am,
    I am animated solely by desire to do my duty to Queen and
    Country, and to meet the convenience of Hon. Gentlemen in
    whatever part of the House they may sit. If you want to write
    to me, address 'Mr. SMITH, England.' I have reason to believe
    that so perfect is the machinery of the Post Office under the
    direction of my Right Hon. friend, that the missive thus
    directed will not fail to reach its destination."</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;On Second Reading of Education
    Bill.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday</i>.&mdash;An old acquaintance looked in at
    Lobby to-night. When he was here, we used to call him LONG
    LAWRENCE. Now he is one of Her MAJESTY'S Judges, and we must
    behave to him as such.</p>

    <p>"How're you getting on here, TOBY?" he said, just as
    friendly as if he were still at the Bar.</p>

    <p>"As your Ludship pleases," I replied, too old a
    Parliamentary Hand to be inveigled into familiarity by his
    unassuming manner.</p>

    <p>Fact is, as, on his further entreaty, I proceeded to explain
    to the learned Judge, we are getting on very well indeed. Truce
    been called in party conflict, and is strictly observed. Mr. G.
    is absent on sick leave&mdash;not keeping out of the way of
    Education Bill, as some will have it. OLD MORALITY back
    to-night; came down in a penny 'bus, in final effort to elude
    discovery of his place of recent retreat. PARNELL also absent;
    news comes to-night that his business is matrimonial; graphic
    accounts current of his expedition "in a one-horse vehicle"
    from Brighton to Steyning.</p>

    <p>"If," says his Ludship, fresh from a Criminal Court, "he had
    been committing, a burglary, and was getting off with the loot
    in the one-horse O'Shay, he could not have taken fuller
    precautions to evade pursuit."</p>

    </div>

    <p>At first some doubt as to truth of story. Been rumoured
    often before. Then comes, in special edition of evening paper,
    the detail: "The ceremony being concluded, Mr. and Mrs. PARNELL
    drove away in the direction of Bramber, Mrs. PARNELL taking the
    whip and reins."</p>

    <p>"Ah!" said DICK POWER, "that's KITTY, and no mistake. She
    always takes the whip and reins. Bet you three to one the
    trick's done."</p>

    <p>SQUIRE of MALWOOD faithful at his post, but he, too,
    observant of the Truce. Everyone tired to death of dullest
    Session ever lived through, and chiefly anxious to bring it to
    an end.</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;In Committee of Supply.</p>

    <p><i>Friday</i>.&mdash;In Lords to-night, Irish Land Purchase
    Bill read Second Time, after series of essays delivered by half
    dozen Peers. Point of honour not to take less than one hour in
    delivery. DERBY brought down his contribution nicely written
    out on quarter sheets. Whilst ASHBOURNE declaiming, DERBY
    seized opportunity to read his speech over to himself. This all
    very well if he had strictly carried out intention, but, when
    he grew so interested in it as to mumble passages in an audible
    voice, situation grew embarrassing. At last KIMBERLEY, who sat
    near, gently nudged him. "One at a time, my dear DERBY," he
    whispered. "We know you're accustomed to dual action. DARBY and
    JOAN, you know; but won't do here."</p>

    <p>DERBY blushed, and thrust manuscript in pocket till his turn
    came, when he had the pleasure of reading it aloud.</p>

    for another run in the provinces, and then back again. Quite a

    <h3>THE PURCHASE-OFFICERS' GUIDE TO THE ARMY.</h3>

    <p>(<i>Arranged in Question and Answer Form.</i>)</p>

    <p><i>Question</i>. I may take it that the backbone of the
    British Army (especially in the time of peace) are those
    commissioned warriors who obtained admission to the Service by
    paying for their footing?</p>

    <p><i>Answer</i>. Indeed you may.</p>

    <p><i>Q.</i> And, at the time when these warriors were
    admitted, I fancy the scientific branches of the Force (the
    "Gunners" and the "Sappers") were rather looked down upon than
    otherwise?</p>

    <p><i>A.</i> Certainly, for you see they obtained their
    Commissions by brains, and not through money-bags.</p>

    <p><i>Q.</i> And now you have to complain that the Generals'
    Establishment has been reduced from 275 to 68?</p>

    <p><i>A.</i> A scandal and a shame! For this means that only a
    certain number of us can hope to wear sashes round the waist,
    instead of hanging down from the left shoulder.</p>

    <p><i>Q.</i> Does not promotion by selection, instead of
    seniority, cause you also considerable loss?</p>

    <p><i>A.</i> Unquestionably. The Purchase Officer had a right
    to suppose that once gazetted he would go up to the top of the
    tree, always supposing he was able to pay his way like an
    officer and a gentleman.</p>

    <p><i>Q.</i> Is it not also sad that Officers who accept
    half-pay should be called upon to serve in the Auxiliary
    Forces?</p>

    <p><i>A.</i> Not only sad, but confoundedly undignified.</p>

    <p><i>Q.</i> And do you not object to your condition
    generally?</p>

    <p><i>A.</i> Yes, certainly. And let me tell you the subject is
    <i>the</i> burning one of the hour!</p>

    <p><i>Q.</i> And what do you think of other matters affecting
    the welfare of the Army?</p>

    <p><i>A</i>. That they are merely details that can safely wait
    indefinitely the consideration of the Authorities!</p>

    <i>Marta</i>&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Whether</i> Kensington Gardens, now sacred to
    nursery-maids and their charges, and a few loungers, couldn't
    be opened up with one or two good rides right across, and a few
    intersecting bridle-paths, after the fashion of the Bois de
    Boulogne, and thus relieve the monotony of the Row, which is
    getting more and more Rotten after every shower, and more and
    more crowded every summer?</p>

    <p><i>Whether</i>, as every equestrian is rightly complaining,
    something cannot be done in time for the season of
    1892?</p><br clear="all" />

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
